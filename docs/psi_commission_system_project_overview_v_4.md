## 1. Purpose and Overview Summary

The PSI Commission System is an end-to-end, automated, and scalable commission management platform for master agencies. It improves accuracy and efficiency in processing **expected vs. actual** commissions, speeds up detection of missed commissions, and raises agent transparency. Using Microsoft Excel, Power Query, and lightweight VBA, the system targets enterprise-grade precision with accessible, low-cost tools.

---

## 2. Scope of Work

**In scope**  
• Power Query–based ETL to ingest carrier payments, agent splits, manual adjustments, and account data.  
• A unified data model producing clean agent statements (Excel table output).  
• VBA automations for exports and validations.  
• Clear SOPs for Virtual Assistants (VAs).

**Out of scope (current phase)**  
• Web portals, external API integrations.  
• Database back ends / cloud migration / Power BI dashboards.  
• Productization packaging (to be considered post‑validation).

---

## 3. Technical Overview and Current Status

### 3.1 Architecture

Power Query groups:
- **00_Config** – Control cells for `BatchId` and `CommissionMonth`.
- **10_Load** – Imports: Payments, Adjustments, Splits, Accounts, Expected_Commissions.
- **20_Model** – Core joins (Payments ↔ Accounts ↔ Splits) and calculated fact tables.
- **30_Output** – `Agent_Statements` generation to Excel table.
- **90_QA** – Automated validation checks and counts feeding the QA Dashboard.

### 3.2 Completed Components

✅ `Config_BatchId` and `Config_CommissionMonth` (global run controls)  
✅ `fnGraniteToPayments` – normalizes Granite raw files  
✅ `Payments_Normalize` – folder import pipeline for Granite  
✅ `Adjustments_Load` – integrates `Manual_Adjustments` table  
✅ `Splits_Load` – effective-date splits  
✅ `Accounts_Load` – derives Global Account Key (GAK)  
✅ `Payments_With_Accounts` – joins w/ QA flags  
✅ `Payments_With_Splits` – applies agent splits  
✅ `Adj_As_Lines` + `Fact_AllLines` – unify payments + manual adjustments  
✅ `Statements_Build` – outputs `Agent_Statements` table  
🟨 `Expected_Commissions_Load` (new) – added to model; used by Step 11 comparisons  
🟨 `QA_Checks` (new) – feeds QA Dashboard (Step 10)

---

## 4. Testing and Validation Plan

Run after **Step 10 (QA Dashboard)** and **Step 11 (Expected vs Actual)** are in place.

1) **Granite Commission Validation** – Compare generated results vs. legacy manual calculations.  
2) **Vigilant Integration Validation** – Normalize, import, compare outputs.  
3) **OBFM Integration Validation** – Normalize, import, compare outputs.  
4) **Cross‑Carrier Regression** – Confirm combined statements remain accurate.  
5) **Export + VA Workflow** – Validate VBA exports and VA SOPs end‑to‑end.

**Acceptance criteria (examples):**  
• 100% of carrier lines accounted for; no orphan payments.  
• ±$0 tolerance on totals per carrier per month.  
• Statement-level diffs explained (rate, timing, chargeback).  
• All QA checks = **PASS**, or explicit, documented exceptions.

---

## 5. Future Carrier Integration (Vigilant and OBFM)

Create new normalizers following the Granite schema:
- `fnVigilantToPayments`
- `fnOBFMToPayments`

Each outputs the shared **Payments** schema so downstream model logic remains unchanged. Validate each carrier individually, then run a cross‑carrier regression.

---

## 6. Design Principles and Next Steps

**Principles**  
1. **Simplicity** – Excel + Power Query + light VBA.  
2. **Transparency** – Full traceability from raw files to agent statements.  
3. **Scalability** – Build once, reuse across carriers.

**Immediate next steps**  
• Finish **Step 10**: implement QA checks + dashboard cards.  
• Finish **Step 11**: Expected vs Actual comparison queries + exception outputs.  
• Validate with live Granite data; then integrate Vigilant/OBFM.  
• Produce final VA SOPs and export macros.

## 7. Order Tracking / **Expected_Commissions** (Build **Step 11**)

### Purpose
Captures “should be getting” data so PSI can reconcile **Expected vs Actual** at a detailed level and surface missed, delayed, or short‑paid commissions early.

### Maintainers
VAs and Operations staff enter/update order information as deals are sold or services change.

### Location
Excel worksheet: **Expected_Commissions**  
Named table: **tblExpected_Commissions**

### Core Fields
| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Carrier** | Network or payor providing the service. |
| **Customer** | End customer name. |
| **AccountNo** | Carrier or internal billing account. |
| **Product** | Product or service sold. |
| **ServiceID** | Circuit/location/service identifier (if known). |
| **StartDate** | Date billing begins. |
| **ExpectedMRR** | Monthly recurring revenue expected. |
| **ExpectedRate** | Commission rate as decimal (e.g., 0.18). |
| **ExpectedPayType** | RES, SPF, BON, etc. |
| **ExpectedStartMonth** | First month Expected applies (1st of month). |
| **ExpectedEndMonth** *(optional)* | Month Expected ends if term‑bound. |
| **Notes** | Context (promo, term, special clauses). |
| **EnteredBy** | Person entering the record. |
| **EnteredDate** | Entry date. |

### Data Flow
1. VAs populate **tblExpected_Commissions**.  
2. Power Query `Expected_Commissions_Load` ingests the table.  
3. `Expected_vs_Actual_Match` compares Expected rows to Actual Payments by **(GAK/AccountNo, Product/ServiceID, Month)** with fuzzy fallbacks (e.g., ProductCode lookup).  
4. Results classify each Expected row: **Not Found**, **Amount Variance**, **Rate Variance**, **Timing Variance**.

### Outputs
- **Expected_vs_Actual_Exceptions** (query) – key exception list for review.  
- **Expected_Aging** (query) – shows how long an Expected line has had no matching payment.

### Governance
Any change to fields or logic is documented here **and** reflected in VA SOPs. Use versioned commits/messages describing the reason and impact.

## 9. Project Governance and Version Control

**Purpose**  
Ensure all files, logic, and documentation remain versioned, auditable, and recoverable.

**Practices**  
• Store Power Query M scripts, VBA modules, and Excel templates in GitHub (or equivalent).  
• Use clear commit messages: _component: short change summary (why/impact)_.  
• Tag major milestones (`v4`, `v5`) or keep versioned files in `/Archive/`.  
• Reflect significant logic/field edits here and in VA SOPs.

**Collaboration**  
• Only verified logic is merged to `main`.  
• Use feature branches + PR review for updates.  
• This document is the authoritative design reference.

---

## 10. QA Dashboard (Data Integrity) (Build **Step 10**)

### Purpose
Provide internal **data‑quality validation** so joins and transforms are correct before financial reconciliation begins.

### Checks (examples)
- **Row counts** – loaded vs modeled per table.  
- **Required fields not null** – `Carrier`, `AccountNo`, `Month`, `Amount`.  
- **Orphan joins** – e.g., payments without accounts or splits.  
- **Effective‑date validity** – overlaps/gaps in splits; invalid statement dates.  
- **Duplicate keys** – same `(GAK, ServiceID, Month, PayType)` repeated unexpectedly.  
- **Rate sanity** – `GrossRate` in [0, 1]; SPIFF presence matches `PayType`.

### Implementation
- Queries: `QA_RowCounts`, `QA_RequiredFields`, `QA_Orphans`, `QA_Dates`, `QA_Duplicates`, `QA_RateSanity`.  
- Union into `QA_Checks` with columns: `CheckName`, `Status (PASS|FAIL)`, `Count`, `SampleLink/FilterToken`.  
- Excel Dashboard: pivot + conditional formatting; slicer on `Status`.

> **Outcome:** Proceed to reconciliation only when **all PASS** or exceptions are understood and documented.
